I have made a mirror of following online helps just because they are so useful and it would be a disaster if original site goes down by any reason:
* [All_About_Your_64-Online Help V0.64](https://c64lib.github.io/cbmdoc/AAY64/INDEX.HTM) (c) by Ninja/The Dreams in 1995-2005 
* [All_About_Your_1541-Online Help V0.23](https://c64lib.github.io/cbmdoc/AAY1541/INDEX.HTM) (c) by Ninja/The Dreams in 1995-2006

These documents were mirrored from http://www.the-dreams.de/aay.html . If you're an author of any of these and you want me to take it off just PM me or create an issue in this repo.
